# 30-Day JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Challenge

Welcome to the 30-Day JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you improve your understanding of data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. Each day, you will be presented with a new problem or concept to explore and implement.

## Getting Started

To participate in this challenge, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript programming language.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any other text editor).
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

## Challenge Format

Each day of the challenge, a new problem or concept will be provided for you to work on. You will be given instructions on how to approach the problem and implement the solution in JavaScript. Some days may require you to implement specific data structures or algorithms, while others may focus on analyzing or optimizing existing code.

You are encouraged to explore different approaches and solutions to the problems. Experiment with different data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques to enhance your problem-solving skills.

## Resources

During the challenge, you may find the following resources helpful:

- Online tutorials and articles on data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.
- JavaScript documentation and reference guides.
- Books on data structures and algorithms, such as "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

Feel free to explore additional resources based on your learning preferences and needs.
